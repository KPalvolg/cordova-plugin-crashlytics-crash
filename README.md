# cordova-plugin-crashlytics-crash

This plugin adds a method to crash the app to generate crash reports for Crashlytics.
Many existing Crashlytics plugins don't add a way to test crashes and crash reports. This plugin is meant to be installed alongside another plugin that integrates Crashlytics into your app.

## Usage

```
CrashlyticsCrash.crash();
```
